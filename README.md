# All_Projects

Welcome to this repo! Here I want to collect all the projects I have been working on during my studies and not.


### Machine Learning
This is a course of the first semester at Physics of Data. It consists on theory and application of some basic methods in ML such as Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression and simple Neural Network structures. Here you can find a pdf file with all the theory that I wrote with one colleague and the assignments that we were supposed to deliver during the lessons.

### Laboratory of Computational Physics
This is an annual course at Phyisics of Data. It is divided in two parts (module A and module B) for the two semesters. 

#### Laboratory of Computational Physics modA
In module A, together with other three smart colleagues, we developed a muon source induced by a positron-electron scattering and you can find the full notebook in the folder. Furthermore, in the folder _Exercises_ there are all the weekly assignemnts we were asked to solve.

### Betty the robot
During the summer, when I was 16, I tried to build from scratch a kind of robot vacuum cleaner with Arduino. My grandfather helped me with the iron skeleton, and te result was a machine able to avoid obsatcles.
