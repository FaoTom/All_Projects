# All_Projects

Welcome to this repo! Here I want to collect all the projects I have been working on during my studies and not.


### Machine Learning
This is a course of the first semester at Physics of Data. It consists on theory and application of some basic methods in ML such as Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression and simple Neural Network structures. Here you can find a .pdf with all the theory that I wrote with one colleague and the assignments that we where supposed to deliver during the lessons.
