# All_Projects

Welcome to this repo! Here I want to collect all the projects I have been working on during my studies and not.


### Machine Learning
This is a course of the first semester at Physics of Data. It consists on theory and application of some basic methods in ML such as Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression and simple Neural Network structures. Here you can find a pdf file with all the theory that I wrote with one colleague and the assignments that we were supposed to deliver during the lessons.

### Laboratory of Computational Physics
This is an annual course at Phyisics of Data. It is divided in two parts (module A and module B) for the two semesters. 

#### modA
In module A, together with other three smart colleagues, we developed a muon source induced by a positron-electron scattering and you can find the full notebook in the folder. Furthermore, in the folder _Exercises_ there are all the simple weekly assignments we were asked to solve.

#### modB
In module B, together with other three smart but different colleagues we were asked to investigate machine learning algorithms in some weekly assignemnts. In particular, in the first exercise we studied different gradient descent and how parameters affects their run towards the global minimum of a given function. Then, we focused on CNN were we also took a bronze medal in a weekly race among the lab groups subscribed to the course. This race focused on designing and training a custom CNN architecture and the team who has got the highest accuracy on an unknown would have win.

### Betty the robot
During the summer, when I was 16, I tried to build from scratch a kind of robot vacuum cleaner with Arduino. My grandfather helped me with the iron skeleton, and te result was a machine able to avoid obsatcles.
