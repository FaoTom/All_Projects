# All_Projects

Welcome to this repo! Here I want to collect all the projects I have been working on during my studies and not.


### Machine Learning
This is a course of the first semester at Physics of Data. It consists on theory and application of some basic methods in ML such as Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression and simple Neural Network structures. Here you can find a .pdf with all the theory that I wrote with one colleague and the assignments that we where supposed to deliver during the lessons.

### Laboratory of Computational Physics
This is an annual course at Phyisics of Data. It is divided in two parts (mod A and mod B) for the two semesters. In mod A, together with other three smart colleagues, we developed a muon source induced by a positron-electron scattering.
